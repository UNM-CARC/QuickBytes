# Logging in

To log in to the CARC systems and start computing you will need a terminal that can log in to remote systems using Secure Shell (SSH). If you are using a Linux or Mac machine you are in luck as they come bundled with a terminal that is ready to use. The terminal application packaged with your OS is great, but if you would like something with a bit more customization, utility, and flexibility there are other free options available. Below are a couple of options that CARC recommends. Note that iterm2 is only available on Mac, and MobaXterm is only available on Windows.


* iTerm2
* MobaXterm


If you are on windows, you can start with using Powershell, however it is recommended to install MobaXterm for a better overall experience.


Now that you have your terminal open you can log in. To do this type the following from the terminal prompt:

```bash
ssh <CARC-USERNAME>@<MACHINE-NAME>.alliance.unm.edu
```

Where `CARC-USERNAME` is the username you were assigned once your account was approved. `MACHINE-NAME` will be one of our carc systems; `hopper`, `wheeler`, or `xena`, for example. If this is your first time logging in, you will get a prompt asking you to accept your computer as a new authorized host. You can accept this first prompt, and you will then be prompted for your password. 

If you are unsure of your current password, please reference [the password reset quickbyte.](password_reset.md)
